# Material UI

### Descripton

This project is to develop my understanding and practice use of using material UI within a react application.

### Goals

- To familiarize myself with Material UI
- Test different file structures to reduce redundancy, but still ensuring clear, readable code
- Replecate commonly viewed webpages without using templates

### Tasks

[ X ] Build a Log-in page  
23/03/2021 - After debating whether to use the compoenent nature of material-ui to keep styling and functionality together, or to seperate as normal, I have decided it best to seperate these as to create standards to be altered by theme.

[ ] Build a dashboard  
24/03/2021 - Decided to test using components and defining everything in containers.
27/03/2021 - Files are becoming very cluttered. Moved all styling into './component', working on functionality in './containers' and will build pages at a later date. Need to format the table to render based on props, headings and data.

[ ] Build a shop-like design
